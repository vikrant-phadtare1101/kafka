==================
Test Descriptions
==================
This test suite performs Kafka system test on the replication feature as described here:
1. Start the Kafka cluster
2. Create topic
3. Find the leader
4. Stop the leader in Step 3
5. Send n messages
6. Consume the messages
7. Start the leader in Step 3
8. Goto Step 3 for all servers in the cluster
9. Validate test results

==================
Quick Start
==================
1. Modify the values of "num_kafka_server" & "replica_factor" as needed.
2. Execute the test as: 
   <kafka home>/system_test/single_host_multi_brokers $ bin/run-test.sh

==================
Expected Results
==================
The following items should match:
1. The checksums of the data files in all replicas
2. The sizes of the data files in all replicas
3. The no. of messages produced and consumed

==================
Notes
==================
1. There is no need to copy and paste the config/server.properties
   files to match the no. of brokers in the Kafka cluster.
2. The required no. of server properties files will be automatically
   generated according to the value of "num_kafka_server".
3. The default values in the generated properties files will be
   copied from the settings in config/server.properties while the
   brokerid and server port will be incremented accordingly.
