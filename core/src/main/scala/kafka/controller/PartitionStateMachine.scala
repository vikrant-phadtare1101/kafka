/**
 * This class represents the state machine for partitions. It defines the states that a partition can be in, and
 * transitions to move the partition to another legal state. The different states that a partition can be in are -
 * 1. NonExistentPartition: This state indicates that the partition was either never created or was created and then
 *                          deleted. Valid previous state, if one exists, is OfflinePartition
 * 2. NewPartition        : After creation, the partition is in the NewPartition state. In this state, the partition should have
 *                          replicas assigned to it, but no leader/isr yet. Valid previous states are NonExistentPartition
 * 3. OnlinePartition     : Once a leader is elected for a partition, it is in the OnlinePartition state.
 *                          Valid previous states are NewPartition/OfflinePartition
 * 4. OfflinePartition    : If, after successful leader election, the leader for partition dies, then the partition
 *                          moves to the OfflinePartition state. Valid previous states are NewPartition/OnlinePartition
