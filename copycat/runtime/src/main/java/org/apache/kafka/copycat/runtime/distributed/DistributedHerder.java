/**
 * <p>
 *     Distributed "herder" that coordinates with other workers to spread work across multiple processes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Under the hood, this is implemented as a group managed by Kafka's group membership facilities (i.e. the generalized
 *     group/consumer coordinator). Each instance of DistributedHerder joins the group and indicates what it's current
 *     configuration state is (where it is in the configuration log). The group coordinator selects one member to take
 *     this information and assign each instance a subset of the active connectors & tasks to execute. This assignment
 *     is currently performed in a simple round-robin fashion, but this is not guaranteed -- the herder may also choose
 *     to, e.g., use a sticky assignment to avoid the usual start/stop costs associated with connectors and tasks. Once
 *     an assignment is received, the DistributedHerder simply runs its assigned connectors and tasks in a Worker.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     In addition to distributing work, the DistributedHerder uses the leader determined during the work assignment
 *     to select a leader for this generation of the group who is responsible for other tasks that can only be performed
 *     by a single node at a time. Most importantly, this includes writing updated configurations for connectors and tasks,
 *     (and therefore, also for creating, destroy, and scaling up/down connectors).
 * </p>
