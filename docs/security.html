<h3><a id="security_overview">7.1 Security Overview</a></h3>
In release 0.9.0.0, the Kafka community added a number of features that, used either separately or together, increases security in a Kafka cluster. The following security measures are currently supported:
<ol>
    <li>Authenticating clients (Producers and consumers) connections to brokers, using either SSL or SASL (Kerberos)</li>
    <li>Authorizing read / write operations by clients</li>
    <li>Encryption of data sent between brokers and clients, or between brokers, using SSL</li>
    <li>Security is optional - non-secured clusters are supported, as well as a mix of authenticated, unauthenticated, encrypted and non-encrypted clients.</li>
    <li>Authorization is pluggable and supports integration with external authorization services</li>
</ol>

The guides below explain how to configure and use the security features in both clients and brokers.

    <li><h4>Prerequisites</h4><br>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Kerberos</b><br>
        If your organization is already using a Kerberos server (for example, by using Active Directory), there is no need to install a new server just for Kafka. Otherwise you will need to install one, your Linux vendor likely has packages for Kerberos and a short guide on how to install and configure it (<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kerberos">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Managing_Smart_Cards/installing-kerberos.html">Redhat</a>). Note that if you are using Oracle Java, you will need to download JCE policy files for your Java version and copy them to $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security.</li>
        <li><b>Create Kerberos Principals</b><br>
        If you are using the organization's Kerberos or Active Directory server, ask your Kerberos administrator for a principal for each Kafka broker in your cluster and for every Linux user that will access Kafka with Kerberos authentication.</br>
        If you installed your own Kerberos, you will need to create these principals yourself:</br>
            <code>sudo /usr/sbin/kadmin.local -q 'addprinc -randkey kafka/hostname@domainname'<br>
                sudo /usr/sbin/kadmin.local -q "ktadd -k /etc/security/keytabs/kafka.keytab kafka/hostname@domainname"</code></li>
        <li><b>Make sure all hosts can be reachable using hostnames</b> - It is important in case of kerberos all your hosts can be resolved with their FQDNs.</li>
        <li><b><a name="jaas_config_file">Creating JAAS Config File</a></b><br>
            Each node in the cluster should have a JAAS file similar to the example below. Add this file to kafka/config dir:
        <pre>
            KafkaServer {
                com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
                useKeyTab=true
                storeKey=true
                serviceName="kafka"
                keyTab="/etc/security/keytabs/kafka1.keytab"
                principal="kafka/kafka1.hostname.com@DOMAIN.COM";
            };

            Client {
               com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
               useKeyTab=true
               storeKey=true
               serviceName="zookeeper"
               keyTab="/etc/security/keytabs/kafka1.keytab"
               principal="kafka/kafka1.hostname.com@DOMAIN.COM";
            };

            KafkaClient {
               com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
               useTicketCache=true
               serviceName="kafka";
            };
        </pre>
            <u>Important notes:</u>
            <ol>
                <li>KafkaServer is a section name in JAAS file used by KafkaServer/Broker. This section tells Kafka Server which principal to use and which keytab this principal is stored. It allows Kafka Server to login using the keytab specified in this section.</li>
                <li>Client section is used to authenticate a SASL connection with zookeeper. It also allows a broker to set SASL ACL on zookeeper nodes which locks these nodes down so that only kafka broker can modify. It is important to have the same principal name across all the brokers.</li>
                <li>KafkaClient section here describes how the clients like producer and consumer can connect to the Kafka Broker. Here we specified "useTicketCache=true" not a keytab this allows user to do kinit and run a kafka-console-consumer or kafka-console-producer to connect to broker. For a long running process one should create KafkaClient section similar to KafkaServer.</li>
                <li>In KafkaServer and KafkaClient sections we've "serviceName" this should match principal name with which kafka broker is running. In the above example principal="kafka/kafka1.hostname.com@DOMAIN.com" so we've "kafka" which is matching the principalName.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b><a name="jaas_client">Creating Client Side JAAS Config</a></b><br>
        Clients (producers, consumers, copycat workers, etc) will authenticate to the cluster with their own principal (usually with the same name as the user used for running the client), so obtain or create these principals as needed. Then create a JAAS file as follows:
            <pre>
                KafkaClient {
                    com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
                    useKeyTab=true
                    storeKey=true
                    serviceName="kafka"
                    keyTab="/etc/security/keytabs/kafka1.keytab"
                    principal="kafkaproducer/hostname@DOMAIN.COM";
                };
            </pre>
        </li>
    </ol></li>
    <li><h4>Configuring Kafka Brokers</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pass the name of the jaas file you created in <a href="#jaas_config_file">Creating JAAS Config File"</a> as a JVM parameter to the kafka broker: <pre>-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/etc/kafka/kafka_jaas.conf</pre></li>
        <li>Make sure the keytabs configured in the kafka_jaas.conf are readable by the linux user who is starting kafka broker.</li>
        <li>Configure a SASL port in server.properties, by adding the following to the <i>listeners</i> parameter, which contains one or more comma-separated values:
            <pre>listeners=SASL_PLAINTEXT://host.name:port</pre>
        If you are only configuring SASL port (or if you are very paranoid and want the Kafka brokers to authenticate each other using SASL) then make sure you set same SASL protocol for inter-broker communication:
        <pre>security.inter.broker.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT</pre></li>

    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Configuring Kafka Clients</h4>
        SASL authentication is only supported for new kafka producer and consumer, the older API is not supported.>br>
        To configure SASL authentication on the clients:
        <ol>
            <li>pass the name of the jaas file you created in <a href="#jaas_client">Creating Client Side JAAS Config"</a> as a JVM parameter to the client JVM:
        <pre>-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/etc/kafka/kafka_client_jaas.conf</pre></li>
            <li>Make sure the keytabs configured in the kafka_client_jaas.conf are readable by the linux user who is starting kafka client.</li>
            <li>Configure the following property in producer.properties or consumer.properties:
                <pre>security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT</pre></li>
        </ol></li>
</ol>
